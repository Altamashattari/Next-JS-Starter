# Next-JS-Starter

---

## What is Next.js ?

- A React framework for production
- A fullstack framework for ReactJS
- NextJS solves common problems and makes building React apps easier
- You still write React code, build React components and use React features like props, state, context etc.
- NextJS just enhaces your React apps and add more features
- NextJS provides a lot of built-in features like routing that help you to solve common problems and clear guidance on how to use those features.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Built-in Server-side Rendering support**

  - Server side rendering is all about preparing the content of a page on the server instead of client.
  - It allows us to pre-render React components on a server.
  - Great for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and initial load.
  - Blending client-side and server side : Fetch data on the server and render the finished pages.

- **File-based Routing**

  - NextJS gets rid of in-code route definition concept.
  - Instead, you define pages and routes with files and folders.
  - You have a special pages folder in NextJS Apps which has to be named as 'pages' and then you are structuring that folder that defines the routes and paths your page supports.
  - Less code, less work, highly understandable

- **Fullstack Capabilities**
  - Easily add backend(server-side) code to your Next/React apps
  - Storing data, getting data, autentication etc. can be added to your React Projects.
